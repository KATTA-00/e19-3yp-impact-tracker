## üåü Unveiling the Vision

Welcome to **ImpaX**, where cutting-edge technology converges with sports, prioritizing the well-being of athletes. Our mission is clear: revolutionize athlete safety through advanced impact monitoring technology.

## üí° Motivation

In the relentless pursuit of excellence, athletes face physical challenges, and the need for a vigilant guardian becomes apparent. **ImpaX** is our response to a critical call - to develop an impact monitoring system that shields athletes from the looming threat of brain disorders. Startling insights, like the 20.2% prevalence of Lewy Body Disease among former athletes, underscore the urgency of our mission ([The Tennessean](insert_link)).

Developing an impact monitoring system to protect athletes from brain disorders is our core motivation. Startling statistics like the 20.2% prevalence of Lewy Body Disease among former athletes highlight the urgency of our mission.

## ‚ö° Problem Domain

- **Quantification of Risk:** Assessing the risk of developing Lewy Body diseases (LBD) in contact sports.
- **Inadequate Impact Measurement:** Current impact-monitoring systems lack in-depth analysis.
- **Call for Improved Systems:** A need for reliable impact-monitoring systems even for non-contact sports.

## üö® Impact Amplified - Our Solution

- **Minimization of Lewy Body Disease and CTE Risk:** Monitoring the cumulative burden of repeated impacts.
- **Proactive Measures:** Enables proactive measures to mitigate risks and protect athletes from potential injuries.
- **Team Management and Strategy:** Real-time monitoring of multiple players facilitates information for player substitution in team sports.
