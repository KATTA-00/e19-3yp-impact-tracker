## Unveiling the Vision
Welcome to **ImpaX**, where innovation meets the field of sports, prioritizing the well-being of athletes. Our mission is to revolutionize athlete safety through cutting-edge impact monitoring technology.

## The Catalyst - Motivation
In the pursuit of excellence, athletes face physical challenges, and the need for a vigilant guardian becomes apparent. **ImpaX** emerges as a response to a critical call - to develop an impact monitoring system that shields athletes from the looming threat of brain disorders. Startling insights, like the 20.2% prevalence of Lewy Body Disease among former athletes, underscore the urgency of our mission ([The Tennessean](insert_link)).

## Navigating the Playing Field - Problem Domain
Within the realm of sports, quantifying the risk of developing Lewy Body diseases (LBD) poses a unique challenge. Traditional impact-monitoring systems fall short, especially in non-contact sports, leaving a gap in our understanding of potential risks.

## Impact Amplified - Our Solution
- **Real-time Vigilance:** Through a smart wearable attached to the headguard, ImpaX provides real-time impact tracking.
- **Insights at Your Fingertips:** A sleek, user-friendly desktop dashboard offers comprehensive data visualization for quick insights.
- **History Unveiled:** Cumulative analysis of head impacts provides a historical perspective, aiding in tailored safety strategies.
- **Beyond Impact:** Beyond safeguarding against impacts, ImpaX tracks other performance metrics vital for athlete well-being.
